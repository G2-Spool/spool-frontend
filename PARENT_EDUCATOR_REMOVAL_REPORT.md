## Remaining Documentation References

The following documentation files still contain references to educator/parent features and should be updated to reflect the new individual learner focus:

1. `/docs/product_vision.md` - Contains legacy references to educators and parents
2. `/docs/functional_requirements.md` - Contains microschool management requirements
3. `/docs/entity_relationship_diagram.md` - Contains educator/parent role definitions
4. `/docs/system_architecture.md` - References educator/parent user attributes
5. `/docs/data_flow_diagram.md` - Contains microschool data flow references

## Validation Results

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED** (no type errors)
- ⚠️  ESLint: Multiple linting issues unrelated to parent/educator removal
- ✅ All parent/educator components successfully removed
- ✅ All routing cleaned up
- ✅ Authentication simplified for individual learners only

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation files to remove all references to educators, parents, and microschools
2. Update any API documentation or backend services that may still reference these roles
3. Consider updating the landing page and marketing materials to reflect the individual learner focus
