# RDS Thread Data Population Summary

## Overview
I've successfully created all the necessary SQL scripts and tools to populate your RDS instance `database-1` with thread data for all 10 users in your Cognito user pool.

## RDS Instance Details
- **Endpoint**: database-1.cmtqo5bo1y3x.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- **Port**: 5432
- **Engine**: PostgreSQL 16.8
- **Database**: spool
- **Username**: postgres
- **Password**: Retrieved from SSM Parameter Store (/spool/prod/rds/password)

## Created Files

### SQL Scripts
1. **`/sql/create-thread-tables.sql`**
   - Creates `threads`, `thread_analysis`, and `thread_sections` tables
   - Includes indexes and triggers for performance
   - Creates a view for easy data retrieval

2. **`/sql/generate-thread-data-all-users.sql`**
   - Generates 2-5 threads per user (25-35 total threads)
   - 30 different educational questions covering STEM and liberal arts
   - Each thread has 3-5 content sections
   - All relevance scores between 80-95% (meeting the threshold requirement)
   - Realistic timestamps over the last 30 days

3. **`/sql/populate-threads-auto-generated.sql`**
   - Auto-generated SQL with specific thread data for each user
   - Includes INSERT statements for all tables

### Execution Scripts
1. **`/scripts/populate-rds-database-1.sh`**
   - Bash script to populate the database (requires psql)
   
2. **`/scripts/execute-rds-commands.sh`**
   - Provides complete instructions for running the SQL via AWS CloudShell
   - Includes all commands needed to populate the database

## How to Execute

### Recommended: AWS CloudShell
1. Open AWS CloudShell in your AWS Console
2. Copy and run the commands from `/scripts/execute-rds-commands.sh`
3. This will:
   - Install PostgreSQL client
   - Create the database and tables
   - Generate thread data for all 10 users
   - Verify the data was created

### Connection String
```
postgresql://postgres:spoolrds@database-1.cmtqo5bo1y3x.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/spool
```

## Expected Data Structure

Each thread contains:
- **User Input**: Educational question (e.g., "How can I build a video game that teaches climate science?")
- **Analysis**: 
  - Subjects: 4-5 relevant academic subjects
  - Topics: 4-5 specific topics within those subjects
  - Concepts: 5-6 key concepts to learn
  - Summary: AI-generated overview of the learning path
- **Sections**: 3-5 content sections with:
  - Title and descriptive text
  - Relevance score (80-95%)
  - Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Estimated reading time (5-12 minutes per section)

## Thread Topics Include
- Game development with climate science
- Mathematics for machine learning
- Brain processing of music and emotions
- Quantum computing explained simply
- Environmental monitoring apps
- Art history and UI design connections
- Data science in sports
- Physics in special effects
- Autonomous robot navigation
- Nutrition and cognitive performance
- Blockchain for social good
- Chemistry in cooking
- Ecosystem balance
- AI music composition
- Renewable energy science
- And 15 more diverse topics...

## Next Steps
1. Execute the SQL scripts using AWS CloudShell (recommended)
2. Update Lambda environment variables with the database URL
3. Test API Gateway endpoints to ensure data retrieval works
4. Verify the /threads page displays the generated data for each user

## Verification Query
After populating, run this to verify:
```sql
SELECT 
    student_id,
    COUNT(*) as thread_count,
    STRING_AGG(LEFT(title, 50) || '...', '; ') as sample_questions
FROM threads
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY thread_count DESC;
```

This should show each user with 2-5 threads and their questions.
