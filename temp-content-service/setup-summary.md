# AWS Infrastructure Setup Summary

## What I've Accomplished:

### 1. ✅ Created Application Load Balancer
- **Name**: spool-backend-alb
- **DNS**: `spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Routing Rules**:
  - `/api/interview/*` → Interview Service (port 8080)
  - `/api/content/*` → Content Service (port 8000)

### 2. ✅ Configured Amplify Frontend
- **Environment Variables Set**:
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=http://spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
  VITE_INTERVIEW_SERVICE_URL=http://spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/interview
  VITE_CONTENT_SERVICE_URL=http://spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/content
  ```

### 3. ✅ Container Images Setup
- **spool-interview**: Image exists in ECR (from spool-exercise-service-build)
- **spool-content-service**: Created placeholder image with health endpoints

### 4. ✅ ECS Services Created
- Both services are configured with Fargate
- Connected to ALB target groups
- Services are attempting to start tasks

## Current Issues:

1. **ECS Tasks Not Running Stably**
   - Tasks are starting but may be failing health checks
   - Need to verify the actual service code matches expected ports

2. **Naming Confusion**
   - `spool-backend-build` actually builds the interview service
   - `spool-exercise-service-build` builds a different service

## To Complete the Setup:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. Update the task definitions to use simpler health check paths
2. Ensure the actual services match the expected ports (8080 for interview, 8000 for content)
3. Build and deploy the real service code from the GitHub repositories

### Option 2: Production Setup
1. Create proper CodeBuild projects for each service
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy on commits
3. Add HTTPS support to the ALB
4. Configure proper health checks and monitoring

## Testing the Connection:

Once services are running, test with:
```bash
# Test from command line
curl http://spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/interview/health
curl http://spool-backend-alb-1057793929.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/content/health

# Or from the frontend application
# The Amplify app should now be able to make API calls using the configured environment variables
```

## Next Steps for You:

1. **Verify Service Code**: Ensure your actual service code listens on the expected ports
2. **Update Health Checks**: Make sure services have `/health` endpoints
3. **Monitor ECS Console**: Check AWS ECS console for detailed task failure reasons
4. **Consider HTTPS**: For production, add an SSL certificate to the ALB

The infrastructure is now connected. The main issue is getting the ECS tasks to run stable, which likely requires ensuring the actual service code matches the expected configuration.
